Аnnоtаtiоn. In the world, corrosion of metals, including carbon steel, is a serious problem in many in-
dustries, especially during processes such as pickling and acid washing of steel. Therefore, the development 
of inhibitory compositions is of great theoretical and practical importance. One of the ways to protect metals 
from  corrosion  is  the  use  of  organic  inhibitors,  which  are  heterocyclic  compounds  containing  phosphorus, 
sulfur, nitrogen and having π bonds. 

Keywords: inhibitory compositions, alcanolamin, Incorgaz T 21, adsorption free energies, gravimetric 

detection. 

P 

urpose of work. Development of a technology for the production of phosphorus, nitrogen, metal-
containing new oligomers based on compounds containing inhibitory compositions and their use 

to obtain polymer composite materials. 

Methods. Studies were carried out by methods of chromium-mass spectroscopy, NMR, NMR, electron 
microscopy, elemental analysis, spectroscopy of electrochemical impedance. Data on the mechanism of the 
corrosion process in the studied media were obtained depending on the duration of the experiment and the 
concentration of inhibitory compositions and their adsorption characteristics were determined. 

Obtaining a corrosion inhibitor is that they carry out the reaction of alcanolamin with an adduct (a mixture of 

phosphoric acid and urea) in a certain ratio of the components taken and in the presence of vegetable oil. 

In a three-necked flask equipped with a stirrer, reflux condenser and thermometer, 20 g of adduct was 
charged. The resulting mixture was heated to a temperature of 120 °C until a homogeneous liquid mixture 
was formed and 10 g of alcanolamin was added with stirring. The mixture was then heated until completely 
homogeneous (1 hour, 120 °C). Then the temperature of the reaction mixture was cooled to 90 °C and 5.5 g 
of  vegetable  oil  was  added.  The  reaction  mixture  with  continuous  stirring  at  a  temperature  of  110  °C  was 
kept for 2 hours. Then the product was cooled to room temperature. 

Scientific  novelty.  Effective  and  cost-effective  metal  corrosion  inhibitors  based  on  organic  com-
pounds have been synthesized. The effectiveness of inhibitors in various aqueous media has been investi-
gated.  Corrosion  current  and  corrosion  rate,  degree  of  protection,  temperature  dependence  of  the  braking 
coefficient, concentration and conditions necessary for optimal protection are determined. 

Practical value. The results of the study expand the  protective mechanism of organic inhibitors and 
help establish a new direction for the effective protection of inhibitor metals. The inhibitors studied have good 
prospects for use in water supply, recycled water, as well as in the oil, petrochemical and gas chemical in-
dustries due to their low toxicity and high efficiency. 

Introduction. The modern protection of metals from corrosion is the introduction into the hostile environ-
ment  of  specially  selected  inhibitor  compounds.  Corrosion  inhibitors  are  organic  and  inorganic  substances,  the 
presence of which in small quantities dramatically reduces the dissolution rate of the metal and reduces its possi-
ble harmful effects. Inhibitor corrosion protection is widely used in many sectors of modern industrial production 
and  agriculture:  when  transporting  gas  and  oil  through  pipelines,  to  preserve  metal  products  in  the  inter-
operational period, to protect against corrosion by fuels and lubricants, as well as in water-salt, acid, alkaline, wa-
ter-organic and organic environments, in fresh, sea water, and corrosion in atmospheric conditions and soil. 

Based on the foregoing, we synthesized oligomeric corrosion inhibitors based on local raw materials, 
which protect metals from corrosion in the heat supply system and ensure reliable operation of all elements 

185 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
of the system by preventing the formation of any type of deposits on the internal surfaces of boilers (heaters) 
and pipelines of heating networks, and all types of corrosion damage to internal surfaces[1].  

Corrosion of equipment is one of the main causes of premature failure of chemical equipment, due to 
exposure to corrosive substances. The most effective method of protecting equipment from corrosion is the 
use  of  corrosion  inhibitors.  We  propose  the  use  of  oligomeric  corrosion  inhibitors,  which,  due  to  the  film-
forming ability of the oligomer, can form thin film coatings on the internal surfaces of equipment, having the 
inhibitory ability to protect equipment from corrosion [2].  

Experimental  part.  Oligomeric  corrosion  inhibitors  were  obtained  on  the  basis  of  a  nitrogen-
containing  adduct  of  melamine  and  urea,  which  interacted  with  various  reagents  to  synthesize  corrosion 
inhibitors. The effect of corrosion inhibitor on steel-20 samples (characteristic of steel-20 material: chemical 
composition of the material in % С-0,17-0,24, Si-0,17-0,37, Mn-0,35-0,65, Ni-0,25, S-0,04, P-0,04, Cr-0,25, 
Cu-0,25,  Аs-0,08)  in  an  acidic  environment  for  240  hours  studied  according  to  GOST  -  9.506-87,                        
GOST -9.505-86, GOST - 9.502-82.  

Results  and  its  discussion.  Corrosion  inhibitor  IK-2  synthesized  on  the  basis  of  secondary  raw 

materials, 1 : 0.5 with alcanolamin with an adduct (a mixture of phosphoric acid and urea). 

Recovered  petroleum  products  contain  mineral  salts  and  mechanical  impurities,  such  as  sodium 

chloride, calcium chlorine, magnesium chlorine, gaseous carbon dioxide. 

The  effects  of  corrosion  inhibition  were  studied  when  exposed  to  acid  and  alkaline  fluids  flowing 

through pipes (table 2). 

Synthesized multicomponent corrosion inhibitors. The mechanism of protection against corrosion and 

the formation of self-regulating surface layers was revealed (Fig. 1).

The results of the study show that the synthesized compositions of corrosion inhibition slow down the 
corrosion processes both on the surface of pure steel and on the surface of corrosive steel. Synthesized in-
hibitory corrosion, reducing the concentration of atomic hydrogen, also prevents the fragility of the metal [3]. 

The values of the free energy of adsorption indicate that the inhibitors function by physical adsorption 
on the surface of the metal. Typically, adsorption free energies of up to 20 KJ / mol correspond to the elec-
trostatic interaction between charged molecules and a charged metal (indicating physical adsorption), while 
values more negative than 40 KJ / mol include charge separation or transfer from molecules inhibitor to the 
metal surface to form a coordination type bond (indicating chemisorption). The results presented in the table 
show that the values of the free energy of adsorption for all studied systems lie between –9.8 and –10.7 kJ / 
mol, which indicates spontaneous adsorption of additives by the mechanism of physical sorption. 

The thermodynamic model is very useful for explaining the phenomenon of adsorption of an inhibitor 

molecule. Adsorption enthalpy can be calculated according to the Vant-Hoff equation: 

 , 

 (1) 

where   ∆H°ads  and  Kads  are  the  adsorption  enthalpy  and  the  adsorption  equilibrium  constant,  respectively 

(table 1). 

Figure 2 shows a graph of the relationship between lnKads и 1/T for inhibitors IK-1, IK-2, IK-3, IK-4 and 
IK-5. Straight-line graphs were obtained, and the adsorption enthalpy was obtained from the slope of the lin-
ear graph [4; 5; 6].  

Adsorption  enthalpy  (∆H)  can  be  roughly  considered  as  the  standard  adsorption  enthalpy  ∆H  °  ads 
under experimental conditions, and the obtained values were 22.5, 20.2, 18.6, 16.1 and 18.1 KJ / mol for IK-
1 inhibitors, IK-2, IK-3, IK-4 and IK-5, respectively.

IK-2 inhibits steel-20 corrosion with a maximum inhibition efficiency of 98.87 % at 30 °C and a maxi-
mum concentration of inhibitor. Inhibitor adsorption obeys the Langmuir adsorption isotherm by the formation 
of  a monolayer  on  the metal  surface;  this  result  was  confirmed  by the  use  of  a  thermodynamic  adsorption 
model. The heats of adsorption were low, which indicated physical adsorption on the metal surface [7–8].  

The chemistry of this interaction and the structure of the reaction products were proved by ЯМR spec-
trometry on a Bruker Avance 400 spectrometer with an operating frequency of 400 МГц. The following sig-
nals  were observed in ЯМР spectra of corrosion inhibiting compositions, IK-2:  1Н ЯМR 1,102 (т., 3H CH3), 
1,20 (м., 1H, CH2), 1,195 (м., 2H, CH = CH2), 2,60 (д., 2H, CH2-C), 3,55 (м., 4H, N-CH2). 13C ЯМР 19.59 
(CH3), 44.31-44.81(СН-СН2), 65.32 (Н-СН2), 40.51, 40.61 (N-CH2), 126.23, 133.44 (CH = CH) (Fig. 3). 

This study clearly shows that the presence of the studied inhibitors protects a weak steel surface from 

corrosion (Fig. 4). 

On the image 4 (B) separate and joint distribution of iron, carbon and oxygen on the  surface can be 

observed steel-20.  

Upon gravimetric detection, the inhibitor inhibition was studied at 30 ° C and 90 ° C for 24-2400 hours. 
As can be seen from the table, 0.05 % of the inhibitor significantly reduces the corrosion rate and increases 
the effectiveness of the inhibitor with increasing temperature [9]. Based on the results of a gravimetric study, 
experiments were carried out to study diagram curves in various media with a synthesized inhibitor (fig 5).

Fig. 5. Chart of St-20 metal inhibitors in various aggressive environments 

The environmental safety of the use of the developed inhibitors in water supply systems and circulat-
ing circulating waters, as  well as in the oil and gas chemical industries, is shown, their effectiveness is de-
termined, which constitutes 98,25 %. 

The  research  results  show  that  the  effectiveness  of  the  applied  oligomeric  corrosion inhibitor  can  be 

observed in the presence of aromatic rings in them, the composition of thermostable and stable structures. 

Conclusion. Synthesized new inhibitors of IK-2. The corrosion protection mechanisms of CT-20 steel 
materials have been studied using modern methods. The results showed that the inhibitors were effective at 
optimal concentration in aggressive environments HCl, H2SO4, NaCl. 

It has been established that the protective properties of an inhibitor of the IK-2 brand depend  on the 

composition, temperature and nature of the oligomer. 

New  effective  composites  of  metal  corrosion  inhibitors  in  aggressive  environments  have  been 
developed. A putative corrosion inhibitor based on alcanolamin and an adduct (a mixture of phosphoric acid 
and urea) was found. The effectiveness of synthesized new substances in gravimetric methods was studied. 
Corrosion rates, braking factors, and protection levels were studied.
